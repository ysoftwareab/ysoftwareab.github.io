            <p>I had the pleasure of working along side Andrei at Tobii Pro for almost 4 years. He joined my nascent
              department as we were getting started on building products on AWS and very quickly proved himself to be
              <strong>very fast learner</strong>, <strong>excellent solver of problems</strong> but also
              <strong>a super good team member</strong> from the perspective of improving others' skills. Many were new
              to web development in general and cloud infrastrucure in particular but together we grew our craftmanship
              as a team alot thanks to Andrei's <strong>ability to bring others along</strong> on the learning curve.
            </p>

            <p>Over the years Andrei <strong>earned everyone's utmost respect</strong> as we grew into a 3 teams strong
              organization basing our development on the same platform but for quite different products. Andrei was
              <strong>instrumental</strong> is establishing our use of AWS, our Devops culture and our solutions to CI
              and CD based on Travis CI and Cloud Formation.
            </p>

            <p>As we part ways now in the winter of 2020 I wish Andrei all the best and I am certain he will be
              <strong>wildly successful</strong> wherever he puts his attention. I truly hope our paths cross again in
              the future work wise. I am sure they will over a glass of fine, japanese whiskey at some nice place.

            <p>Without any hesitations, Andrei is <strong>the best Software Engineer</strong> I've ever got a chance to
              work with.</p>

            <p>He has a <strong>vast experience</strong> in everything related to Computer Science and he knows his way
              around almost everything when it comes to Web and Cloud development.
              <strong>Thinking often several steps ahead</strong>, he identifies problems and comes up with solutions
              that are robust and simple at the same time.
            </p>

            <p>Andrei is a <strong>fast learner</strong> and worker and you can be surprised by his work pace. But you
              would be even more surprised by the fact that every decision Andrei takes about system design, code
              styling or testing have <strong>a reason behind</strong> them and are usually carefully thought through,
              even though they may be looking hasty. Question him about them and you won't be disappointed by his
              reasoned answers.</p>

            <p>Andrei is <strong>always on the edge</strong> of the best practices and techniques and his proficiency in
              development tooling allows him to automate many routines in his personal and team's workflow.</p>

            <p>The last but not the least, Andrei is <strong>a caring person</strong> and
              <strong>a great teammate</strong> who takes care about coworkers, their productivity and well-being.

            <p>Andrei is <strong>a highly productive developer</strong>, with skills in many different fields and
              programming languages. He was shown an unusually large ability and drive to <strong>quickly learn</strong>
              new programming languages and technologies. He has <strong>a very analytic and focused mindset</strong>
              and is <strong>skilled</strong> at reasoning about technical problems or solutions. Having Andrei in our
              team was <strong>very valuable</strong>, especially when new solutions to difficult problems were
              discussed, prototyped and implemented.</p>

            <p>He has an impressive ability to <strong>quickly comprehend a complex problem</strong> after just a short
              chat about it. Often I just mentioned a few keywords and he gladly helped me solve difficult problems with
              even less communication effort than it would have been to write a ticket about the bug or problem.</p>

            <p>Most of the time he has been a few months before the rest of us when it comes to
              <strong>foreseeing technical problems</strong> with a design, and sometimes a few years (like when it
              comes to designing future-proof API:s etc.)
            </p>

            <!-- <p>He can at times seem a bit blunt, but that's just because he speaks his mind and doesn't pretend to like
              your bad solution when it's rightfully stupid. This has been <strong>very valuable to our team</strong>
              while developing Klarna Checkout, and I think any company that is into software development would find
              Andrei a valuable team member.</p> -->
